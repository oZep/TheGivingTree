## Timeline
I wanted to give a little breakdown of the events that occured during the month of June 2023 leading up to the completion of this project. 

Between balencing summer school courses and exams, I wanted to work on a small and managable project. This brought me to create The Giving Tree: A story-based interactive horror game.

* During the UOttawa Game Dev club game night on **June 1st**, we were notified that the upcoming theme for the next jam would be **'Nature Strikes Back.'** I remember that the minute I heard this, I remmebered one of my favourite childhood book called *The Giving Tree* which was written by Shel Silverstein. I knew that whatever I wanted whatever I created to fit into that theme, and take inspiration from the story-line. I had a lot of ideas, but between balencing summer school courses and exams, I decidied to choose something smaller in scale and managable. This brought me to create The Giving Tree: A story-based interactive horror game.
* Between **June 2nd and June 6th**, I began planning out the game. I wrote out the storyline, planned out the interactive elements I wanted to implement and the series of events I wanted my players to go through. After that, I created a series of voice line scripts, and constructed the template of what I wanted the map to look like on paper.
* I officially created this project on **June 7th**, after being satified with my planing.
* Between **June 7th and June 23rd**, I worked with Unity 3d and C# to implement everything
* I have finished and submitted this project as of **June 24th**.

I'm glad to say that I've finally been able to accomplish what I set out to do. This is my first time working with Unity 3D, and I actually really enjoyed the expereince. I hope to create many more games in the future, so stayy tuned!
