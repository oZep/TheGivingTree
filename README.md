# TheGivingTree
June 2023 Game Jam Submission for the UOttawa Game Dev Club

## Timeline
Ive been working on this project for the whole month of June. Between balencing summer school courses and exams, I wanted to work on a small and managable project. This brought me to create The Giving Tree: A story-based interactive horror game.

* During the UOttawa Game Dev club game night, we were notified that the upcoming theme for the next jam would be 'Nature Strikes Back.' I remember that the minute I heard this, I remmebered one of my favourite childhood book called *The Giving Tree* which was written by Shel Silverstein. I knew that whatever I wanted whatever I created to fit into that theme, and take inspiration from the story-line.
* I first created this project on June 4, after being satified with my plan and series of events I wanted my game to implement.
* I have finished and sumbitten this project as of June 24.

I'm glad to say that I've finally been able to accomplish what I set out to do. This is my first time working with Unity 3D, and I actually really enjoyed the expereince.
